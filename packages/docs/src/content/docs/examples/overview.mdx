title: Examples Overview
description: Runnable example applications demonstrating machina patterns.
---

machina ships with five runnable example apps covering real-world patterns — from async health checks to React integration. Each one is a self-contained app you can run locally, and on the deployed docs site they're live at their own routes.

## Examples

| Example                                                 | What it demonstrates                                          | Key machina features                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Connectivity Monitor](/examples/connectivity/)         | Network connectivity tracking with async health checks        | `createFsm`, async in `_onEnter`, `AbortController` cleanup in `_onExit`, custom events |
| [Traffic Intersection](/examples/traffic-intersection/) | Hierarchical traffic light controller with pedestrian signals | `_child` delegation, `compositeState()`, input bubbling, `defer()`, child auto-reset    |
| [Dungeon Critters](/examples/dungeon-critters/)         | Multiple critter instances sharing one FSM definition         | `createBehavioralFsm`, per-client state via `WeakMap`, shared behavior definition       |
| [Shopping Cart](/examples/shopping-cart/)               | Checkout flow with deferred operations                        | `createFsm`, `defer()`, `defer({ until })`, lifecycle hooks                             |
| [With React](/examples/with-react/)                     | React integration for a todo app                              | `createFsm`, `useSyncExternalStore`, framework integration                              |

## Try them live

On the deployed docs site, each example is a working app at `/demos/{name}/`. The doc pages above explain the patterns; the "Run" link at the top of each page opens the live app in a new tab.

During local development, examples run on their own Vite dev server — the docs site doesn't serve them. See below.

## Running locally

```sh
# Run any example's dev server
pnpm --filter @machina-examples/connectivity dev

# Or from the example directory
cd examples/connectivity && pnpm dev
```

Swap `connectivity` for any of the example names: `traffic-intersection`, `dungeon-critters`, `shopping-cart`, or `with-react`.
