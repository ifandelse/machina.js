import { Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<CardGrid>
    <Card icon="seti:typescript" title="TypeScript-First">
        Written in TypeScript from the ground up. Full type inference for states, inputs, and
        transitions.
    </Card>
    <Card icon="random" title="Hierarchical States">
        Nest FSMs as child states with automatic input bubbling and delegation between parent and
        child machines.
    </Card>
    <Card icon="puzzle" title="Behavioral FSMs">
        Define behavior once, apply it to n-number of independent clients with zero additional
        overhead.
    </Card>
    <Card icon="rocket" title="Minimal Ceremony">
        Define states, handle inputs, transition. No generics gymnastics. Just FSMs that solve your
        problem and get out of your way.
    </Card>
    <Card icon="list-format" title="Deferred Inputs">
        Queue inputs that arrive before a state is ready to handle them. Replay automatically on
        transition.
    </Card>
    <Card icon="approve-check-circle" title="Lifecycle Hooks + Events">
        Fine-grained hooks for enter, exit, and transition events. Subscribe to exactly what you
        need.
    </Card>
